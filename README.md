LetterBoxN - a feature-rich movie review app.
Users can add and read reviews of movies, as well as explore new and trending movies, tv shows, podcasts.
I have tried to implement clean code principle within MVVM framework.
This project uses the official API of TMDB to fetch realtime data with the following technologies:
- MVVM with Clean Architecture
- Material Design 3 elements
- Coroutines & Flows (StateFlow, SharedFlow)
- Hilt for Dependency Injection
- Navigation Component, Navigation drawer
- Room Database
- Firebase Firestore for authentication
- Retrofit2, OkHttp3
- Paging3 for pagination
- My custom pop-up message library â†’ NancyToast
- MotionLayout in SplashScreen
- Shimmer placeholder, Glide, Coil libraries

Check out some screenshots from the app:
